Robot Control Panel
This is a simple web application that allows controlling a robot's movement using a control panel. When a direction button is clicked, it displays a pop-up window with the first letter of the direction and opens a new window displaying the same letter. It also sends the letter to a PHP file for further processing.

Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
PHP
XAMPP (or any other web server stack with Apache, PHP, and MySQL)
Setup and Usage
Install XAMPP or a similar web server stack that includes Apache, PHP, and MySQL.

Start the web server and make sure Apache and MySQL modules are running.

Place the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files in the appropriate folder of your web server. For XAMPP, the default folder is typically htdocs in the XAMPP installation directory.

Open a web browser and visit http://localhost/your_folder_name/index.html, replacing your_folder_name with the actual folder name where you placed the files.

The webpage should now be displayed, showing the robot control panel.

Click on any of the direction buttons (Forward, Left, Stop, Right, Back). It will display a pop-up window with the first letter of the direction, open a new window with the letter displayed, and send the letter to the PHP file for further processing.

You can check the console in the web browser for any success or error messages related to the data sending process.

Database Configuration
To configure the database for storing the letters sent by the control panel, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have a database server (such as MySQL) set up and running.

Create a new database in phpMyAdmin or any other database management tool.

Update the PHP code in process.php with the correct database credentials and table name.

Set the $servername variable to the hostname or IP address of your database server.
Set the $username variable to the username for accessing the database.
Set the $password variable to the corresponding password.
Set the $database variable to the name of the database you created.
Set the $table variable to the name of the table where you want to store the letters.
Save the changes to process.php and ensure it is in the same directory as the other files.

Troubleshooting
If the webpage is not displayed correctly or the buttons don't work, verify that the file paths and folder names are correct.

Check the browser console for any error messages or response text when clicking the buttons. This can help identify any issues related to AJAX requests or data sending.

Ensure that the PHP file (process.php) is correctly configured with the database credentials and table name.
